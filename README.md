# Potato-Disease--Classification-using-CNN
# Potato-Disease-Classification-using-CNN

Project Description
This project aims to build a mobile application that helps farmers detect diseases in potato plants using deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The application will classify potato plants as healthy or identify if they are affected by early blight or late blight diseases. Early blight is caused by a fungus, and late blight is caused by microorganisms. Accurate detection allows farmers to apply appropriate treatments and minimize economic losses.

# Key Features:

AI-driven backend that classifies plants as healthy or infected with early blight or late blight.
Deep Learning model using TensorFlow and CNN for image classification.
Backend powered by FastAPI and TensorFlow Serving for real-time model inference.

Technologies Used:
Model Building:

TensorFlow
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Data Augmentation
TF Dataset API
Backend & ML Ops:

# Project Workflow:
Data Collection:

Gather images of potato plants affected by early blight, late blight, and healthy plants.
Use data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, scaling) to increase dataset size and diversity.
Model Building:

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow for image classification.
Use the TensorFlow Dataset API for efficient data processing.
Model Optimization:

Optimize the trained model for mobile devices using TensorFlow Lite.
Perform quantization to reduce the model size and improve performance on mobile devices.
